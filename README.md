# Chess Game


![](board_demo.gif)

A chess game built in Windows Forms, a platform totally unsuited for real-time rendering (but I made it work somehow).

Currently there is a single mode of play, 2-player local. After each player moves, the camera smoothly moves around to the other side of the board. If you're playing alone you can imagine that this is you walking around to the other side :)

This is a project I created for a highschool project.
